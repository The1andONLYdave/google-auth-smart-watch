Some tests require LittleMock and DexMaker to compile and run.
The two libraries need to be included into the APK.

* LittleMock: http://code.google.com/p/littlemock/
* DexMaker: http://code.google.com/p/dexmaker/

When importing this project into Eclipse, add littlemock.jar and dexmaker.jar
to the "libs" directory of this test project.
